Final Project

My final project idea is to look at the temperatures in Antarctica over a period of time.
I have a source here https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.6378
This gives me mean temperatures from different stations in Antarctica over a period of 29 years and 4 different seasons.

The data could look at comparing different stations means temps or different temps at different seasons.

I have taken the data from the article and put it into an excel file
