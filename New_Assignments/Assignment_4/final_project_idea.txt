Final Project

My final project idea is to look at different fungi species around antarctica.
I'm taking my data from this website https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071710003998
Like you said in class, I'll put it into a cool map, can also map the pH levels and such that they
have in their dataset.

The ggplot that I made is still from the last article that I mentioned in class.
I have taken the data from the article and put it into an excel file


test
