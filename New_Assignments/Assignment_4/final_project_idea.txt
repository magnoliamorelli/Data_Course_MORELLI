Final Project

My final project idea is to look at different fungi species around antarctica.
I'm taking my data from this website https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071710003998
Like you said in class, I'll put it into a cool map, can also map the pH levels and such that they
have in their dataset.

The ggplot that I made is still from the last article that I mentioned in class.
I have taken the data from the article and put it into an excel file


Use library(rvest) to help get data off website

cntrl+shift+c will give us our investigator to give table data

content <- read


for reading excel files do librry(readxl)

df <- read_xlsx

can do read = "A2:C3" will just read those rows and such, can do sheets


make data,R,and output files
save each script as you go for a new one such as cleaning, then ...

library(rvest)

content <- read_html("https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071710003998")
content %>% html_nodes(xpath='html/body/div') %>% 
  html_table()  ##this is making if I scrape##

##if I make an excel##

make data,R,and output files
save each script as you go for a new one such as cleaning, then ...

str_remove_all(df$c_n,pattern = "[^[:alnum:]]", "") ## this removes * from columns
as.matrix(df) %>% heatmap()



### how to make a new function

remove_special <- function(x){str_remove_all(x,pattern = "[^[:alnum:]]", "")} %>%
as.numeric


df%>% map(remove_special) %>% ###map applies whatever to every column	
as.data.frame()


clean <- clean %>%
select(-x1)
row.names(clean) <- names(clean)

as.matrix(clean) %>% heatmap()   ##this will create a map to what is most related

## saving cleaned data
write_csv("./Data/cleaned_test.csv")
or
saveRDS(clean,"./Data/cleaned_test.RDS") ## if saving large object will save it as kind of object

save R script for each layer of the project,cleaning,explore_data,making plots, report
